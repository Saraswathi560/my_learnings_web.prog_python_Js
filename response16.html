<! --<a To make the CSS more powerful we make use of responsive Design. It is important for the presenting webpages. The important aspects of the responsive webpages is: Viewport, Media Queries, Flexbox and Grids.
	1. Viewport is the visual part of the screen where the user actually see it. Viewport is the entire area of the web page and it displays the content to the user. It is useful for opening the webpage in various devices. That is if we open a webpage on a computer and the same webpage needs to be adjusted into the other devices. So we make use Viewport in the HTML File.
	2. Media Queries: It is all about controlling how the page is going to dependent on and how we render on that page.
	3. If we have multiple elements that display on the same webpage, then we make use of Flexbox. If we have a six boxes on a web page in a row on our computer and same web page is opened on the mobile device then the 3 boxes are visible but the other 3 are other side which is not able see by user. Inorder to do so we need wrap around the white spaces and divides into 2 rows for this example. So we make use of flexbox.
	4. Grid: Arranging the things in the grid layout  -->
