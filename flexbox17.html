<! --<a Flexbox: If we have multiple elements that display on the same webpage, then we make use of Flexbox. If we have a six boxes on a web page in a row on our computer and same web page is opened on the mobile device then the 3 boxes are visible but the other 3 are other side which is not able see by user. Inorder to do so we need remove the white spaces and divides into 2 rows for this example. So we make use of flexbox. -->
